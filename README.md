# backwards

A backwards programming language. If you can understand this, your a god.

## Purpose

This is not to be intended as a real programming language, but I'm not stopping you for using it. Spread the love. This is for me to learn how a programming language is created. I'll be writing a lexer, parser, type checking and interpreter. This maybe be integrated into my operating system, DeanOS.

## Features/How to
