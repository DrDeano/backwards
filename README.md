# backwards

A backwards programming language. If u can understand this, your a god.

## Purpose

This is not to be intended as a real programming lanuage, but I'm not stoping you for using it. Spread the love. This is for me to learn how a programming lanuage is created. I'll be writing a lexer, parser, type checking and interpreter. This maybe be intergrated into my operating system, DeanOS.
